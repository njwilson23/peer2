%%%
%%%                        MACSYMA, possibly the oldest surviving
%%%                        computer symbolic algebra system, was
%%%                        developed starting about 1968 at the
%%%                        Massachusetts Institute of Technology, using
%%%                        the MACLISP dialect of the Lisp programming
%%%                        language.  The name stood for Project MAC's
%%%                        SYmbolic MAnipulation System, and MAC stands
%%%                        for Man and Computer, or for Machine Aided
%%%                        Cognition.  Project MAC later became the MIT
%%%                        Laboratory for Computer Science, certainly
%%%                        one of the premier institutions in the field.
%%%
%%%                        In the 1980s, MACSYMA was ported to the Franz
%%%                        Lisp dialect by Richard Fateman's research
%%%                        group at the University of California at
%%%                        Berkeley, enabling it to be run on DEC VAX
%%%                        computers running Berkeley UNIX.  It was also
%%%                        ported by a U.S. Department of
%%%                        Energy-supported effort at MIT, to NIL,
%%%                        another Lisp dialect.  The U.S. DOE version
%%%                        was further developed by William Schelter at
%%%                        the University of Texas in Austin under the
%%%                        name Maxima, until his untimely death in July
%%%                        2001.
%%%
%%%                        In 1982, MACSYMA became a commercial product
%%%                        marketed by Arthur D. Little, Inc., later
%%%                        Symbolics, Inc., and finally, Macsyma, Inc.,
%%%                        but the latter company went out of business
%%%                        in 1999, and with it, technical support for
%%%                        licensees, and further development.

%%%                        With the permission of the U.S.DOE,
%%%                        development of Maxima now continues as a

                 algorithm for computing the Greatest Common Divisor
                 (GCD) of two multivariate polynomials over the
                 integers. The algorithm is strongly influenced by the
                 method used for factoring multivariate polynomials over
                 the integers. It uses an extension of the Hensel lemma
                 approach originally suggested by Zassenhaus for
                 factoring univariate polynomials over the integers. We
                 point out that the cost of the Modular GCD algorithm
                 applied to sparse multivariate polynomials grows at
                 least exponentially in the number of variables
                 appearing in the GCD. This growth is largely
                 independent of the number of terms in the GCD. The new
                 algorithm, called the EZ (Extended Zassenhaus) GCD
                 Algorithm, appears to have a computing bound which in
                 most cases is a polynomial function of the number of
                 terms in the original polynomials and the sum of the
                 degrees of the variables in them. Especially difficult
                 cases for the EZ GCD Algorithm are described.
                 Applications of the algorithm to the computation of
                 contents and square-free decompositions of polynomials
                 are indicated.",

                 algorithms and heuristic procedures for indefinite and
                 definite integration, yet these system facilities are
                 not as generally useful as might be thought. Most
                 isolated definite integration problems are more
                 efficiently tackled with numerical programs.
                 Unfortunately, the answers obtained are sometimes
                 incorrect, in spite of assurances of accuracy;
                 furthermore, large classes of problems can sometimes be
                 solved more rapidly by preliminary algebraic
                 transformations. In this paper we indicate various
                 directions for improving the usefulness of integration
                 programs given closed form integrands, via algebraic
                 manipulation techniques. These include expansions in
                 partial fractions or Taylor series, detection and
                 removal of singularities and symmetries, and various
                 approximation techniques for troublesome problems.",

  abstract =     "Computer algebra systems such as Maple, Mathematica
                 and MACSYMA are readily available for a wide range of
                 PC's and workstations. Many college campuses have site
                 licenses for these software tools and make them widely
                 available to students through PC labs, across networks
                 and on time sharing systems. Additionally student
                 versions of these software tools are widely available
                 at nominal cost. Computer algebra systems provide
                 sophisticated computational support and are intuitive
                 to use. In this paper we describe how we use a computer
                 algebra system to support an upper division
                 undergraduate course teaching elementary queueing
                 theory. We discuss the significant enhancement added by
                 using a computer algebra system for this course work.
                 We present the traditional approach to this material,
                 i.e., deriving the closed form solutions for a specific
                 queueing model then we show how we approach the
                 material using numerical solutions based on the general
                 equations for steady state probabilities for a Poisson
                 Birth-Death process. We present several examples and
                 discuss the strengths of our approach.",

                 experience of the current developments in LISP and
                 specialized LISP hardware happening in Europe, America
                 and Japan. This research will have major implications
                 for computer algebra and algebra system
                 environments.\par

                 Although LISP, by its extensible nature, has always
                 been an evolving language, unconstrained by standards,
                 the past few years have been amongst the most active.
                 In the field of language work there have been
                 SCHEME-84, Common LISP, Standard LISP 85 and 3-LISP,
                 whilst in hardware there are the continuing development
                 of Symbolics, the arrival of Texas Instruments, several
                 experimental machines in Japan, such as FLATS, Alpha
                 and TAO, and the start of similar projects in
                 Europe.\par

                 How all these factors will affect future developments
                 and implementations of REDUCE, MACSYMA and SCRATCHPAD
                 will also be discussed.",

                 behandelt, die heute in den gr{\"o}{\ss}eren Systemen

                 realisiert ist. Das erste Kapitel ist der Diskussion
                 verschiedener \CA\ Systeme mit Beispielen gewidmet. Die
                 wichtige Frage der Repr{\"a}sentation der
                 mathematischen Objekte auf einem Computer ist das Thema
                 des zweiten Kapitels. Der Algorithmus von Buchberger,

                 in Chebyshev polynomials and manipulating such
                 expansions are described. A data structure is
                 introduced to represent a truncated expansion in a set
                 of orthogonal polynomials which contains the
                 independent variable, the name of the orthogonal
                 polynomial set, the number of terms retained, and a
                 list of the expansion coefficients. The package
                 converts a given expression into the aforementioned
                 data structure. Special cases are the conversion of
                 sums, products, the ratio, or the composition of
                 truncated Chebyshev expansions. Another special case is
                 converting an expression free of truncated Chebyshev
                 expansions. The package generates exact expansion
                 coefficients whenever possible. In addition to
                 well-known Chebyshev expansions, such as for
                 polynomials, the authors provide new methods for
                 getting exact Chebyshev expansions for reciprocals of
                 polynomials of degree one or two, meromorphic
                 functions, arbitrary powers of a first-degree

                 algorithm for the symbolic integration of rational
                 functions containing nested exponential and logarithms.
                 For the class of transcendental functions, the Risch
                 algorithm represents a practical method for symbolic
                 integration. Because the Risch algorithm describes a
                 decision procedure for transcendental integration it is
                 an ideal final step in an integration package. Although
                 the decision characteristic cannot be fully realised in
                 a computer system, because of major algebraic problems
                 such as factorisation, zero-equivalence and
                 simplification, the potential advantages are
                 considerable. The symbolic language, MACSYMA contains
                 an implementation of the Risch algorithm which will be
                 examined and compared for functionality with an
                 implementation written for the symbolic/numeric system
                 SENAC. Several elementary transcendental integrals are
                 presented to analyse MACSYMA's implementation. The

  abstract =     "In MACSYMA, there are procedures for solving systems
                 of equations, such as solve and linsolve. Because the
                 systems of equations we are dealing with are mostly
                 sparse, the application of Gaussian elimination which
                 is used in linsolve produces results that are usually
                 lengthy and inefficient. The authors have implemented a
                 new derivation procedure to solve the problem of
                 expression growth and increase the computational
                 efficiency. The underlying concept is the
                 identification of the smallest full subsystems
                 contained within the original and then subsequent
                 remaining systems, labeling common terms by
                 intermediate variables. Gaussian elimination is
                 employed to solve these subsystems independently and
                 sequentially instead of the complete system.",

                 form by eliminating redundancies and including all

                 representing the dependencies amongst the system's
                 variables can be used to simplify the problem of
                 explicitly or numerically integrating the system.",

                 a graphical, interactive tool for specifying the
                 handling of Jacobian matrices and linear solvers. It
                 automates such routine but difficult tasks as correctly

                 the Jacobian to data structures used by a linear

  abstract =     "Formal Laurent-Puisieux series (LPS) are important in
                 calculus and complex analysis. In some computer algebra
                 systems (CASs) it is possible to define an LPS by
                 direct or recursive definition of its coefficients.
                 Since some operations cannot be directly supported
                 within the LPS domain, some systems generally convert
                 LPS to finite truncated LPS for operations such as
                 addition, multiplication, division, inversion and
                 formal substitution. This results in a substantial loss
                 of information. Since a goal of computer algebra is to
                 work with formal objects and preserve such symbolic
                 information, CAS should be able to use LPS when
                 possible. There is a one-to-one correspondence between
                 formal power series with positive radius of convergence
                 and corresponding analytic functions. It should be
                 possible to automate conversion between these forms.
                 Among CASs only MACSYMA provides a procedure power
                 series to calculate LPS from analytic expressions in
                 certain special cases, but this is rather limited. W.
                 Koepf (1992) gave an algorithmic approach for computing
                 an LPS for a very rich family of functions. It covers
                 e.g. a high percentage of the power series that are
                 listed in the special series dictionary (E. R. Hansen,
                 1975). the algorithm has been implemented by W. Koepf
                 and A. Rennoch in the CAS Mathematica (1991). The
                 author presents some example results of the Mathematica
                 implementation which gives insight in the underlying
                 algorithmic procedure. (7 Refs.)",

  abstract =     "Many numerical methods used in power system simulation
                 require the computation of Jacobian matrices. This
                 being particularly true for implicit integration
                 algorithms, and not for explicit ones. These
                 computations often take a significant proportion of the
                 overall CPU time. This paper presents an application of
                 the automatic differentiation method which results in
                 large savings in the computation of Jacobian matrices.
                 An original application of this method is in a software
                 which simulates power systems dynamics. As the program
                 enables the users to introduce their own models,
                 automatic differentiation becomes particularly
                 efficient. In comparison with numerical
                 differentiation, it leads to a saving of 80\% of the
                 time required for the computation of the Jacobian
                 matrices and up to 28\% of the total CPU time.
                 Automatic differentiation is a very efficient method
                 which should be valuable to other power system
                 software, in particular those which offer users the

                 and MACSYMA are readily available for a wide range of
                 PCs and workstations. Many college campuses have site
                 licenses for these software tools and make them widely
                 available to students through PC labs, across networks,
                 and on time-sharing systems. In addition, student
                 versions of these software tools are widely available
                 at nominal cost. Computer algebra systems provide
                 sophisticated computational support and are intuitive
                 to use. In this article we describe how we use Maple to
                 support an upper-division undergraduate course teaching
                 elementary queueing theory. We discuss the significant
                 enhancement added by using Maple for this coursework.
                 We present the traditional approach to this material
                 (i.e., deriving the closed form solutions for a
                 specific queueing model), then we show how we approach
                 the material using numerical solutions based on the
                 general equations for steady state probabilities for a
                 Poisson Birth-Death process. We present several
                 examples and discuss the strengths of our approach.",

                 field for the Taylor--Couette flow of a polymer
                 solution is derived solving the resulting first order
                 ordinary differential equation of fifth degree
                 analytically. Intensive use is made of computer algebra
                 systems AXIOM and MACSYMA to find the exact solution.
                 The coaxial cylinders in the Taylor--Couette flow
                 problem are assumed to rotate at different angular
                 velocities. The geometrical and kinematic parameters
                 can be chosen arbitrarily. The model equation for the
                 material law of the viscoelastic liquid is based on the
                 thermodynamic model for dilute solutions due to
                 Lhuillier and Ouibrahim (1980) which is an analogy to
                 the earlier paper of Frankel and Acrivos (1970). In the
                 present investigation the influence of the parameters
                 of the viscoelastic model on the velocity profile in

  abstract =     "The Macsyma system arose out of research on
                 mathematical software in the AI group at MIT in the
                 1960s. Algorithm development in symbolic integration
                 and simplification arose out of the interest of people,
                 such as the author, who were also mathematics students.
                 The later development of algorithms for the GCD of
                 sparse polynomials, for example, arose out of the needs
                 of our user community. During various times in the
                 1970s the computer on which Macsyma ran was one of the
                 most popular nodes on the ARPANET. We discuss the
                 attempts in the late 70s and the 80s to develop Macsyma
                 systems that ran on popular computer architectures.
                 Finally, we discuss the impact of the fundamental ideas
                 in Macsyma on the author's current research on large
                 scale engineering and socio-technical systems.",
